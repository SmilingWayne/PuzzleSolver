# Linesweeper 

The task is to create a single continuous non-intersecting loop that connects the centers of the grid cells.

The numbered cells cannot be passed through; the number in the cell indicates how many of the eight surrounding cells should contain some part of the solution path. 

For example, a "O" clue means that the 8 surrounding cells can't be passed through by the loop at all.
