# Gappy

Gappy ("Gaps") is played on a square grid. The aim is to blacken some cells of a grid according to the following rules:

Each row and each column contains two black cells.

No black cells touch each other, not even diagonally.

Numbers outside the grid show the number of white cells between black cells in corresponding row or column.


The rules and examples can be found [here](https://www.janko.at/Raetsel/Gappy/index.htm):
