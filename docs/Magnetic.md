# Magnetic

- Some magnetic and some neutral dominos are put together to a rectangle.
- Each magnetic domino has two poles, one positive pole (+) and one negative pole (–). Each neutral domino has two neutral poles (x).
- Two positive or two negative poles cannot touch orthogonally.
- A number on the edge of the grid indicates how many positive (+) and negative (–) poles are in the corresponding row or column.
- Your task is to label the dominos!
