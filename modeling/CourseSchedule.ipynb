    "# Course Assignment Problem (a small exploration)\n",
    "\n",
    "We have 500 course exams and 3000 students, each course is ensured to have at least one student enrolled, besides, we have 70 time slot. We want to assign each course exam to a time slot, each time slot is given a cost in advance, each student that have courses exammed at the slot will have corresponding cost (This cost indicates students' welfare, because students will feel angry for assignments such as \"Not willing to have exams at 8:00 A.M., or Not willing to have exams during weekends, or Not willing to have exams at the end of exams weeks\").\n",
    "\n",
    "We hope to assign each course exam to a time slot such that the total cost is minimized. \n",
    "\n",
    "CONSTRS:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Students cannot have two exams simultaneously at one slot;\n",
    "2. Each course exam must be assigned to a time slot;\n",
    "\n",
    "CAUTION:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Different students have different number of courses, range from 3 to 10."
